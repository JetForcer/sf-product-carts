Original Task: Google Doc

The main goal is the Product Cart page implementation.

You need to implement a page that will meet the user stories

User stories (high-level, with no acceptance criteria on purpose)

- As a user, I can open Product Cart page from Opportunity layout
- As a user, I can see minimal info about the Opportunity on the page
- As a user, I can filter displayed product by Family and Type
- As a user, I can select a product and add it to Cart
- As a user, I can see products in the Cart
- As a user, I can checkout cart. This will create Opportunity Line Items for selected opportunity.
